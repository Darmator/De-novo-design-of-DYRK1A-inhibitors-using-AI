# AI-Driven Discovery: Exploring Generative Models for Novel DYRK1A Protein Inhibitors

## Abstract

We explore the applications of two distinct generative AI models in the search for new inhibitors of the DYRK1A protein, a promising therapeutic target for addressing specific aspects of Alzheimer's disease and other conditions. A key aspect of this work involves training predictive models on properties of interest, such as molecular affinity to the protein or toxicity. These models were instrumental in guiding the generative process and screening potential candidates. Furthermore, some proposed candidates are being experimentally tested  achieving promising inhibition percentages.
